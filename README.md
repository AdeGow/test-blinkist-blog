DESCRIPTION
This React on Rails app is divided into to sections: the Magazine section for visitors to read articles and the editors dashboard section to create A/B Tests.
The A/B Test aims at comparing two variations of the same article to see which variation is more successful. Landing on an article page, each visitor is randomly assigned a variation of the article. The variation remains the same throughout the session of the visitor navigating on the Magazine website.
